Hey this is my first website!
I am teaching myself React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
I want to make this website so I can see the progress as a frontend developer.
Please be gentle I am still learning :)

Things to do still!
- Move the fricken text over (02/14/25)
- Add a clicker game
- Create an about me section
- Create a github link
- Create a place where people can leave comments!
- Create a task board for all my tasks
